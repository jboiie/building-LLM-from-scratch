# Building LLM's from scratch
---

## Goal
To explore and implement the core building blocks of LLMs in a hands-on way — starting from tokenization and moving gradually towards training small models.

## Note
This repo is not meant as a tutorial or guide.  
It’s a work-in-progress space where I document what I learn, experiment with ideas, and make mistakes along the way.
